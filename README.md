## Getting Started

### Including Required Files

To include the required files for the library, the following lines should be added to the `<head>` section of your `html` file:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/cube.css">
<script defer src="path/to/cube.js"></script>
```

### A Minimal Example

Rubik's cube models can be generated by creating `Cube` objects. These objects store information about the state of the cube, and contain the methods that can be used to interact with the model. To create a `Cube` object, you will need to create a `<div>` element to hold the cube:

```
<div id="container"></div>
```
                

Then, create the `Cube` by specifying the `id` of the containter element:

```
const cube = new Cube("container")
```

To see the model that this code generates, see our [getting started page](https://ed963.github.io/cube.js/start.html)

### A Note on Cube Notation

By default, the model will be rendered in "interactive" mode. This means that there will be a user interface beside the cube with buttons that can be used to rotate the faces of the cube. The letters on the buttons reference standard Rubik's Cube Notation. For more information about Rubik's Cube Notation, see [https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/).
